    "Any given image can be considered as a matrix of pixels where each pixel contains (R,G,B) values between 0-255. Each color is represented as an unsigned 8-bit integer. In this lab, we will learn how to read an image into an ndarray or data frame and manipulate that Frame to do some interesting operations on the image. We will also learn how to do low rank estimations using Singular Value Decomposition. You will learn how to find a low rank estimations for a given image and use concepts such as Singular Value Decomposition and/or Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to understand more about the image structure.\n"
